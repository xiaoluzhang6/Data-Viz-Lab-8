## SCU MSIS Program Fact Sheet: <br>
This is a redesign of Lab 5, where we presented a fact sheet about the MSIS Program at SCU. Below is the original version: <br>
<img width="1008" alt="screen shot 2017-11-10 at 4 39 32 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32026039/32686599-9e930a1c-c65c-11e7-90f6-ae600650661c.png">

There are several things that could be improved with this fact sheet:<br>
1) The motivation of the audience was not considered more carefully; I had presented a graph of salary growth for data analysts, but this gave the assumption that all graduates of the program is going to be a data analyst, which is a complete generalization of career paths of MSIS program grads. In reality, there are a wide variety of career paths available to graduates, not limited to just data analysts. <br>

2) Adding to the point from above, because I didn't keep the audience's specific motivations in mind, I presented an inappropriate metric in the first salary graph; this would be a better metric for a fact sheet/dashboard for prospective students considering the MSBA (Masters in Business Analytics) at Santa Clara University.<br>

3) I had also misundertood the requirement of the original lab; in my mind, a fact sheet would be a very forward way of presenting data to the audience in a simple way, such as in a list or table. In doing so for the two tables on skill coverage and capstone projects, I was basically presenting raw data to an audience who may or may not have any background knowledge on the program; the way the information laid out in front of them could be difficult to absorb and the argument/claim of the presenter may be lost on the way.<br>

4) The presenter of the information should give guidance to the audience and at the same time, convey the message clearly. In my case, it was not only to present information about the MSIS program at SCU, but also to compare between similar programs in California and allow the audience to see the advantages of coming to SCU.<br><br>

### Plan of Action:<br>
~ Adjust first graph to present more relevant information specific to the MSIS Program.<br>
~ Present the information for the two tables in a way that could be understood by anyone (including those with no background knowledge of the program or schools)<br><br>

### Version 1: <br>

### Discussion<br>
Chart 1: For this chart, I used the same ranking data from lab 6. This is a better metric/important info for prospective students looking to shop around for the right school. I created a quadrant type chart, where the schools are placed in reference to their overall ranking (Y axis) and MSIS program ranking (X axis). I created additional parameter lines to divide the chart into 4 quadrants. This allows the visualisation to guide the viewer through the information; the viewer will quickly understand the ranking of each school in reference to eachother. Cognitively, most people will know that the it is better to be in the top right quadrant rather than the bottom left. Without knowing the exact ranking information, the viewer will know that SCU is placed at a hight position than the other two schools.<br><br>

Chart 2: Similarily, the viewer will see that the MSIS program at SCU not only has the most number of ranked skills on Linkedin, but also the highest coverage as well. After the chart gets their attention, they can look further down in the table for exact skills and their ranking.<br><br>

Chart 3: This chart also uses a quadrant chart to convey two sets of information: number of capstone project options offered, and the nature of these options. The viewer will understand by just reading the title and seeing the relevant positions of the shapes that SCU not only offer alot more options to their students, but these options will also teach them practical application in the real world. The used of combined information in all three charts helps the audience to understand (1) The MSIS program at SCU is ranked higher than similar programs in the area, (2) it offers a much more comprehensive and practical education, (3)and it also takes a practical approach to ensure graduates will be able to apply what they learned. All of this information can be conveyed to the audience within couple of seconds whithout the viewer having to digest a lot of reading <br>

## Changes After Class<br>
Final Version:<br>
<img width="1154" alt="screen shot 2017-11-11 at 11 24 59 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32026039/32692827-f8689bca-c6d3-11e7-8cc8-2172a92fa705.png"><br>

After feedback after class, I took off the 3rd chart for Capstone projects, as this information is not presented well on a chart (just listing facts). Instead, I combined the skills coverage by courses (%) with the student-faculty ratio. This not only shows that SCU has the smallest ratio (higher quality education) as well as the program here covers more hot skills listed on Linked in (also points to higher education quality). There is a definite contrast between the schools on the chart as well, showing that the other competing schools have a bigger class size and doesn't cover close to as much skills as SCU does.<br>
